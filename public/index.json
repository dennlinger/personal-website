[{"categories":null,"contents":"Filing for a Spousal Green Card from Abroad, an Attempted Guide with Timeline TL;DR: Immigrating into the US is a long and arduous process, even on \u0026ldquo;easy mode\u0026rdquo; when obtaining a permanent residence through a spouse. I detail the primary steps of the immigration process for a foreign-based consular filing process, which differs somewhat from the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; immigration process through US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It involves 1. the pre-conditional filing for an expedited process through a consulate/embassy (form I-130), 2. similar-ish filing of the \u0026ldquo;green card application form\u0026rdquo; (form DS-260), 3. a visa interview at the consulate, for which you 4. need a whole lot of additional forms, documents and the like. A full timeline can be found at the end of this blog post!\nI just moved to the United States, primarily as motivational support for my amazing wife, who will start her own PhD this year! The process of moving to the US is not an easy one, and I found that a lot of the sources online don\u0026rsquo;t really document the process in its entirety super well.\nParticularly for spousal situations, there are a number of special circumstances that can drastically change the processing time (and the shape of the process itself), which is why I decided to write a more cohesive \u0026ldquo;guide\u0026rdquo; (or, I guess, \u0026ldquo;experience report\u0026rdquo;) on the Green Card application process.\nI also want to preface this article by saying that we are very lucky in that we both have extremely supporting families, as well as the financial means to stem the (relatively pricey) immigration fees, plus a \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo; foreign nationality (the German passport currently ranks second in \u0026ldquo;passport power\u0026rdquo;). In addition, the process is very time-consuming. I have a weird sort of affection for \u0026ldquo;bureaucracy\u0026rdquo;, so I definitely coped with the endless forms and collecting evidence much better than others probably would. As a relatable reference point, ask yourself how much you enjoy filing your taxes, which feels pretty similar (although shorter).\nIf you really don\u0026rsquo;t like filing forms and dealing with bureaucracy by yourself, I would strongly recommend you to instead consult a company specialized on helping you with the US immigration process, instead of doing it by yourself. From what I understand, these generally start at around 1000$ (in addition to the regular filing fees), but may save you many hours of worrying. However, I want to emphasize that each individual step is (generally) well-documented, and nowadays a lot of country-specific information can be found online, which makes the process significantly easier to do by yourself.\nThat being said, accumulating all the necessary information on each individual step, mentally parsing it, and the stress of ensuring that a 500$ (non-refundable) application is correct, does really \u0026ldquo;cost\u0026rdquo; you mental energy as well. Please factor this into your calculation when deciding how to go about this process. At no point was I ever \u0026ldquo;completely lost\u0026rdquo; in the process, but you will likely find a few points in this article where I have strong opinions about particular design choices in the process, which may make it especially frustrating to deal with.\nI understand that applying for a green card is not as easy for everyone, but still hope that the article is useful to some of you! If you have any corrections, comments, or want to tell me more about your own journey, feel free to message me at dennis.aumiller@gmail.com!\nAlso, some general nomenclature for this article that I will refer to mostly by their acronyms (or relatively \u0026ldquo;vague\u0026rdquo; terminology). Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, each of these topics will be discussed in greater detail later on:\nBeneficiary: The person obtaining the eventual Green Card. Later on also called applicant. Petitioner: The person sponsoring the Green Card (usually a US citizen, potentially (?) also a US permanent resident). May also be called the sponsor (but not necessarily the financial sponsor, see I-864). USCIS: The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The main service to handle immigration requests. DCF: Direct Consular Filing. A procedure to obtain a visa through a countries consulate instead of the US-based USCIS. NVC: National Visa Center: as far as I understand, this entity is primarily relevant for the filing process when based in the US. Not sure if it is relevant for the filing in a DCF process, but a name that frequently pops up, regardless. I-130: \u0026ldquo;Petition for Relative Alien\u0026rdquo;. The original document to request an eventual Green Card Application Process, for an immediate relative (spouse/child/parent) ,filed by the Petitioner. DS-260: The \u0026ldquo;actual Green Card application form\u0026rdquo;, filed by the Beneficiary of the I-130. I-864: Affidavit of Financial Support. A form certifying that the (financial) sponsor (either the petitioner or another person) guarantees financial support of the petitioner for their stay in the US. Medical Exam: As the name indicates, a medical examination of your mental and physical state. Presumably to reduce the risk of being a burden on the US medical system later on? Other disclaimers:\nThe list of filing fees is accurate as of May 2023 and conversions are made with a EUR-USD exchange rate of 1:1.1 (one Euro is worth roughly 1.1 USD). While I aim to update this article somewhat regularly, USCIS has already announced that they will be (drastically?) increasing the filing fees in the near future. Should this motion pass, I suspect the process will be even costlier. This article is discussing the prospective immigration from abroad, which implies form I-130. If you are already living in the US, you might want to look up information on form I-485 instead. The process is (from what I understand) very different, so YMMV. This is not legal advice. Please always consult with an immigration lawyer (instead of a random online stranger) if you are looking for particular help regarding your individual circumstances! The Pre-Start: Requesting Direct Consular Filing (DCF) A definite advantage during the application process was the US nationality of my wife. There are a number of different visa categories (way more than I could list here), but the general entry points for any skilled worker are basically the H-1B visa (sponsored by an employer), or the J-1 visa for academics (postdoctoral scholars, could have been potentially relevant in my case).\nHowever, if you are married to a US citizen, you can immediately apply for a Green Card, or, in our case, a \u0026ldquo;Conditional Residence\u0026rdquo; permit, as we were married for less than two years before applying. This is formally known as the \u0026ldquo;CR-1\u0026rdquo; visa, which has the primary advantage that there is no fear of immediate expiration (beyond a divorce in the first few years after obtaining the CR-1 visa). If you are a couple with a US citizen spouse, but married for more than two years, you would immediately apply for a IR-1 visa (Immediate Relative), which is valid for 10 years.\nThe initial step for a family-related immigration process would be to complete form \u0026ldquo;I-130: Petition for Relative Alien\u0026rdquo; (I found the naming of \u0026ldquo;alien\u0026rdquo; oddly entertaining throughout the process). This essentially requires a US citizen (or permanent resident) to petition for you (the beneficiary) to become a permanent resident in the United States.\nThey key problem here lies in the fact that these petitions have to be centrally processed by the US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), which even for spousal petitions can take more than a year in waiting time (AFAIK, the current waiting times are estimated with at least 12 months, up to 25)!\nA lesser-known fact, however, which drastically accelerates the processing time, is the alternative of a \u0026ldquo;Direct Consular Filing\u0026rdquo; (DCF) process. Instead of submitting the initial petition I-130 with the central USCIS office in the US, it is possible to claim \u0026ldquo;exceptional circumstances\u0026rdquo;, which require you to obtain a permanent residence for a spouse/child in accelerated fashion. The basic requirements to qualify for a DCF are essentially:\nThe petitioner being a US citizen (AFAIK, it may still be possible for permanent residents to request DCF, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t look too much into it). Have a permanent address abroad (i.e., currently reside in a country that is not the US). Have a \u0026ldquo;valid reason\u0026rdquo; for moving back to the US (most likely, a change of jobs, as it was the case in our situation). There are other exceptions, such as military relatives, but again, I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on our case\u0026rsquo;s circumstances. If you satisfy all three conditions, it is possible to go through your local consulate or embassy (in our case, the Frankfurt Consulate), and request a DCF through them.\nThis actually sounds quite easy, but already here, the US government isn\u0026rsquo;t making it particularly straightforward for applicants, as the original forms can be quite hidden. In the case of Frankfurt, you have to navigate an actual Google Form to file for DCF.\nIf you think that these \u0026ldquo;exceptional circumstances\u0026rdquo; apply to you, you can file an \u0026ldquo;I66 request\u0026rdquo; with the Consulate for expedited processing of your visa through the Consulate instead of USCIS (i.e., the \u0026ldquo;DCF\u0026rdquo;). FWIW, the request itself is fairly simple, i.e., stating how the circumstances apply to you by listing your nationality, the current residence abroad, and the reason for an impending move back to the US. Furthermore, you should provide some evidence for the relocation, in our case the acceptance letter at a US university (FWIW, most online resources are fairly adamant about providing a work contract. IMO, this makes more sense to me, but universities in the US somehow don\u0026rsquo;t issue work contracts to PhD students??). Our request was granted within a few days of submitting it, even with the \u0026ldquo;weaker\u0026rdquo; supporting document of an acceptance letter as the sole evidence.\nThe Real Start: \u0026ldquo;Petition for Relative Alien\u0026rdquo; (Form I-130) Once you get approved for the DCF by the consulate, you have to submit the same documents required for a \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; I-130 filing process. The only difference is the eventual submission address, which goes directly to the consulate instead of USCIS\u0026rsquo; US mailing box. All submitted documents must be in English (or come with an English translation by a certified translator). I am not sure whether the certification of the translator needs to be from the country in which the consulate is, but I would clarify that before translating anything.\nGenerally, USCIS\u0026rsquo; information page for form I-130 is reasonably good for checking the required documents.\nFiling the I-130 includes the following documents:\nForm I-130 itself (essentially filed by the \u0026ldquo;petitioner\u0026rdquo;, i.e., the US citizen). Form I-130a (additional information about the \u0026ldquo;beneficiary\u0026rdquo;, i.e., the person wanting to immigrate). Passport pictures in US format (2x2 inches, with odd requirements. I really strongly suggest to get the pictures taken by a photograph who knows what they are doing.Otherwise, the entire application may be rejected on grounds of a wonky picture, which would be silly). Proof of citizenship. Proof of the US citizenship of petitioner. Proof of the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s foreign residence (this may be only relevant for DCF cases). This can be a residence permit or other form of confirmation of residence. Proof of citizenship of beneficiary (in case of DCF). Ideally, picture of passport. Proof of relationship. In our case, a marriage certificate (depends on the relation between petitioner and beneficiary, of course). \u0026ldquo;Proof of bona fide marital relationship\u0026rdquo;, for spousal cases. See below for more information. Payment of the filing fee (535 USD), which need to be provided as a cheque. Proving a \u0026ldquo;Bona Fide Marital Relationship\u0026rdquo; This last point, \u0026ldquo;proof of bona fide marital relationship\u0026rdquo;, is what really cost us a lot of time and trouble. Essentially, USCIS/the consulate want to see a convincing case to believe you are \u0026ldquo;actually married\u0026rdquo;, and not just faking it for the sake of obtaining a visa. Gathering such information is obviously a lot easier today than it used to be, but it still is a relative pain in the butt, depending on how thoroughly you keep documents and how readily you have them available (all in English language, of course). The online forms we have looked at generally list financial commitments of a couple as a solid reason, which includes, e.g., insurance policies on both spouses, jointly held bank accounts, joint purchase of property, or joint children (again, hilariously dry to think of your own children as a \u0026ldquo;joint financial commitment\u0026rdquo;, but true nonetheless).\nSince we only recently got married before the application, we still had most of our finances separated, and did not really have explicit payments that would indicate the financial commitments (most of our shared payments, like rent, were in a single name, and we made sure to equalize the financial burden by having the grocery bill paid by the other person, etc.).\nInstead, it is also possible to provide further evidence, such as pictures of the couple (we fortunately had a long history of those), particularly with other people in them (for what I assume to be harder to fake?). Additionally, text messages/letters/communications are accepted as a form of evidence (again, we had plenty of those, bless GDPR and Facebook\u0026rsquo;s data request function). We also had some receipts of shared flights \u0026amp; gifts throughout our relationship, which we promptly included (make sure those are also in English!). And finally, you can submit letters of support by friends or relatives, for which we sampled six in total (written by our parents plus some close friends).\nIn total, we submitted around 70 pages of evidence, mostly consisting of pictures (30 pages), messages (20 pages), other evidence, such as flight documents (10 pages), and 10 pages of affidavit letters by our friends and relatives.\nA comprehensive list of potentially relevant documents that we loosely used as orientation can be found on this website.\nSubmission of I-130 Finally, the payment for the processing fees must be included as a cheque in your application. This is probably the most difficult to obtain for the average (foreign) applicant, and we had to get a cheque mailed by in-laws in the US\u0026hellip; I recommend getting started earlier on this than we did, as the cheque is an absolute necessity, and must be for US dollars, too. Local currency will not be accepted, and I do believe cash is also not an option.\nWhile we were initially scared that our relatively \u0026ldquo;weak\u0026rdquo; list of documents would not be sufficient for a reliable verification, we did indeed get the confirmation to go ahead within a week, without request for any visa interview! This seemed to be somewhat faster than previously reported for a Frankfurt filing, and also exceeded our expectations based on the Consulate\u0026rsquo;s own timeline (I believe the upper limit they set is ~60 days to process). We can only speculate what prompted them to go ahead so quickly, but I again suspect that my German nationality, education level, and general history together (5+ years) are reasonably strong grounds to make me not fake something.\nPart 2: Filing the Actual Green Card Application (Form DS-260) With the confirmation mail from the consulate, we got two separate notifications. One for the petitioner, which did not contain much information, and one more exhaustive message to the beneficiary. In the latter email, we found more information on how to proceed, which included a request to file form DS-260 (\u0026ldquo;Immigrant Visa Electronic Application\u0026rdquo;, i.e., the actual Green Card Application form) and collect a number of other documents to eventually submit during a visa interview at the handling consulate.\nConfusingly, DS-260 is usually handled by the State Department\u0026rsquo;s National Visa Center (NVC for short), but in the Direct Consular Filing process, it usually means that there is some odd internal handling within the consulate, which still lets users access the NVC platform, albeit with a slightly different user interface (as the Consulate itself will be handling all responsible aspects of the particular application). Also, the application for DS-260 now entirely rests on the beneficiary of I-130, i.e., the foreigner. To avoid confusing, I will still refer to the person listed in DS-260 as the \u0026ldquo;beneficiary\u0026rdquo;, even though they are now technically the \u0026ldquo;applicant\u0026rdquo; (and the I-130 \u0026ldquo;petitioner\u0026rdquo; is now only required as the sponsoring entity in some specific forms/fields).\nProcess Overview and Documents Required In addition to the request of filing DS-260, the Consulate\u0026rsquo;s mail also lists a number of documents that need to be brought for the eventual visa appointment; these overlap in some portion with the documents needed for the original I-130 petition (but still need to be provided again!), and each document needs to be brought in the original plus one copy. Conveniently, the documents in this round may be provided in English or the language of the Consulate\u0026rsquo;s host country (in our case, German). This means that you do not necessarily need to get certified translations for these documents, which reduces the additional cost quite a bit.\nThese documents should already be available from your I-130 application:\nMarriage certificate (+ eventual prior divorce certificates, annulments or death certificates of prior spouses) for spousal filings. Proof of citizenship (i.e., scan of the beneficiary\u0026rsquo;s passport/ID card). Passport-style photograph in the same style as for I-130 (one picture necessary, 2\u0026quot;x2\u0026quot; format). In addition, the following documents are required for the visa interview. Note that official documents need to be provided twice: once as the original, plus one copy (this affects the birth certificate, police / prison / military records, marriage certificate; also include a copy of your passport, just to be sure):\nBirth certificate of beneficiary. Police records of the beneficiary. These must be translated, if (and only if) the records show any entries. Notably, police records need to be presented for any country that the beneficiary has lived in for more than 12 months at a time (in the last 10 years, I believe). This is not required for police records from prior stays in the US. In addition, if there are entries in any of the police records, a court/prison record must be presented. Military records of any service by the beneficiary. Medical Examination from a Consulate-certified physician. In Germany, there are a total of four practices that are certified; one in Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich and Hamburg, respectively. Notably, this document may be obtained at a point in time after the actual visa interview at the time of writing. This is likely because of the large backlog in examinations (the soonest date available during our application process was two months out from when we checked). Affidavit of (financial) Support: Form I-864. This one is probably the most tricky document to obtain, and we will discuss more on this in a bit. The confirmation page received after filing DS-260 (includes a bar code). The confirmation mail/page after registering for the \u0026ldquo;premium delivery option\u0026rdquo;, if applicable. The alternative is to pick up documents at/near the consulate after they have been processed. Importantly, this item is what I forgot during my own preparation; I am not sure if I simply overlooked it, but I felt it was relatively mentioned less than other required documents. Note that the eventual application fees for DS-260 will be due at the Consulate visa appointment. This is unlike the US-based processing timeline, where the payment has to be made during the web application of DS-260, AFAIK.\nThe filing fee for DS-260 is currently ~325$. It is stated online that the I-864 processing fees only apply to processing within the US, otherwise the additional 120$ will be waived (which was the case for our DCF process). FWIW, payments can be made with credit card, cash, or cheque at the Consulate for this step. So it is not as stringent as the payment process for form I-130.\nFiling DS-260 Filing form DS-260 itself is relatively straightforward, although tedious: The application system, or \u0026ldquo;Consular Eletronic Application Center\u0026rdquo; (CEAC), as it is formally called, has the feel and performance of an early 2000s web application (not kidding, the recommendations for compatible browsers include Internet Explorer 8!). As a consequence, the system may disconnect at any point in time, so make sure to save often (and early) in the process. Note that these disconnects are not the timeout of the website itself (after 20 minutes of \u0026ldquo;inactivity\u0026rdquo;, you will be disconnected), which also potentially disrupt your application, as it might well happen that you spend more than 20 minutes on a singular page. This is unfortunately also counted as \u0026ldquo;inactivity\u0026rdquo;, so, yeah\u0026hellip;\nMy personal recommendation is to fill out the basics on each page, i.e., a single residence, save, and continue to the next step. Only then actually go back to the previous page and supply a full list (e.g., all your previous places of residence). This way, you can always save, even if you may not have completed the full history, yet.\nThe information needed for the form is once again similar to I-130, although almost exclusively pertaining to the history of the DS-260 applicant (i.e., the I-130 beneficiary), and not the original petitioner in I-130. The biggest difference to information already filed in I-130a is that some of the fields now require a much longer history than before. For example, instead of providing a list of addresses for the past 5 years, as it was the case in form I-130a, now you have to provide every address since turning 16, which may be a lot longer.\nUsually, googling the respective fields (and wording) would yield decent clarifications on how to fill DS-260, so I highly recommend doing that if you are unsure.\nThe list of hardest-to-obtain information for DS-260 in my experience was:\nThe entry date and length of stays for the past five visits to the United States. Fortunately, even the US government realizes just how specific this is; here, they state that approximate dates may be sufficient. The address history since turning 16 for any \u0026ldquo;permanent residence\u0026rdquo; (excluding, e.g., vacation stays, etc.). I suspect that an exact date/location may also be near-impossible to obtain for older applicants, so lenience is to be expected. Just make sure that the length and locations match the submitted documents during the visa interview (specifically for police records). Your complete employment history for the past 10 years. This includes a phone number of the company, as well as the name of your supervisor there. I have no idea whether they reach out to them, especially since some of my former bosses have since left the company. Figuring out whether my current academic institution (i.e., a university granting me a degree in the near future) should be included in the \u0026ldquo;history of attended post-secondary education institutions\u0026rdquo;, particularly since I have not (yet) been awarded a degree there. Yet, the form does not allow a setting that says \u0026ldquo;until present\u0026rdquo;. I filled it in anyways and hoped for the best. The remaining application can be more (or less) complicated, depending on your personal circumstances. Not having children or prior spouses, as well as having a relatively strong passport (i.e., not requiring a visa for US entries), made things a lot easier in my case, I believe.\nMedical Exam Regarding the medical exam, it should be noted that this also costs quite a bit of money, mostly depending on the country where you obtain it from. Unfortunately, in Germany the exam is quite expensive, and can easily total around 500€ (390€ for the exam, plus additional costs of up to 150€ for additional lab tests). Confusingly, the medical exam in my case could have been completed after the visa appointment, which I assume is due to the expected waiting time with the certified physicians. In any case, I would always check with your specific consulate to figure out what is (and isn\u0026rsquo;t) possible. Either way, the visa process will only be completed once the medical exam is submitted by the examining physician, so delays in the processing time are very probable for late medical exams.\nYou are required to provide a relatively comprehensive list of vaccinations for the medical exam; most of these could be done the day of your exam, but in particular the Covid-19 immunization must be completed beforehand (or otherwise, cause delays until the immunization process is completed). In case you do not have access to your vaccination history, I would suggest consulting your GP beforehand, to avoid issues regarding the vaccination status.\nThe exact list of vaccinations depends on the age of the applicant, and can be found here: Careful! The list on the USCIS website (respectively the list on the State Department\u0026rsquo;s website) include more vaccines than are necessary for the typical adult. Some of these are only relevant for specific age ranges! I personally used this table provided by the CDC to determine which are actually necessary.\nAdditionally, I had to pre-fill a form of known medical conditions, both physical and mental (basically anything that required treatment by specialists). Fortunately, I only had some minor corrective surgeries, and did not have much to fill in here. I assume that the eventual medical exam may take much longer in such cases.\nThe eventual exam was relatively straightforward, since I made sure to prepare all the necessary documents ahead of time. This includes bringing a print-out of your confirmation page after submitting DS-260, the consulate case number (which you get after filing the initial request with the consulate). Please always check with the doctor\u0026rsquo;s office what documents are expected during the appointment.\nThe in-house lab drew some blood and did the required chest X-ray (to check for Tuberculosis), which was then followed by a ~20 minute conversation with the panel physician. They checked my blood pressure, breathing, vision and we had a brief chat about my listed medical conditions before concluding the exam. The whole thing took just about an hour, which was considerably shorter than the \u0026ldquo;please plan around 3 hours for the medical exam\u0026rdquo; written on their website.\nAffidavit of Financial Support (I-864) Regarding the Affidavit of Support (I-864), it is required that you can provide means of financial support that equal 125% of the US Government\u0026rsquo;s poverty threshold by the petitioner (or another joint sponsor). The official reason is to avoid the beneficiary being a \u0026ldquo;financial burden\u0026rdquo; on the US social system. The current poverty guidelines can be easily found online, and are dependent on the size of the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s US household (usually, the household includes whoever is currently living in that household + one additional person (the petitioner); make sure to not include the petitioner again when providing a joint sponsor). For the realistic case where a US citizen is sponsoring their spouse, i.e. a two person household, the 125% mark equals an annual gross income of ~25k$ per year for the 2023 poverty guidelines.\nHowever, just because you do have an income, does not automatically mean that it can be used as a means of financial support. In our case, for example, the US government would not accept academic stipends from a PhD program as a valid \u0026ldquo;source of income\u0026rdquo;, even though said stipend was guaranteed for at least four years in advance.\nThe exact reason is not quite clear (but honestly, the regulation is quite stupid regardless). Some argue that it has to do with the fact that a PhD stipend is usually temporally limited (whereas the I-864 requires consistent financial support for an unspecified amount of time). I suspect that it has more to do with the goal of obstructing immigration for relatives of academics who by themselves are already having a hard time immigrating back into the US, if on a J-visa. This suspicion is supported by the fact that evidence of a pay stub or job contract (which can be otherwise used as evidence) also do not provide any information about the \u0026ldquo;longevity\u0026rdquo; of said jobs, and may in fact only be temporal employments.\nAs an alternative, I-864 fortunately also allows you to specify other assets (such as property value, financial assets, etc.) to substitute missing income. From our understanding, you need to provide three times the difference between the actual gross income and the poverty guidelines in assets (for spouses and children; five times for any other sponsored person). Meaning if you have no \u0026ldquo;actual income\u0026rdquo;, you would need to provide ownership of assets for about ~75,000$ total. Note that this is seemingly not per year, but rather a total amount. In any case, online resources generally urge to file assets only in really dire situations, and otherwise attempt to strengthen the application by using income directly, ideally through a joint sponsor.\nJoint sponsorship refers to the case in which another person, who does not even have to be directly related, will promise to provide the financial means required for the Affidavit of Financial Support. In the case of a joint sponsor, the actual income needs to be adjusted for the total household size of their own family plus the applicant (the original Green Card sponsor may or may not be included in that household size). Again, we were lucky enough that my in-laws offered to fill the affidavit on their behalf, which eliminated the need for a more thorough vetting of our own assets.\nInfo: Note that, irrespective of the utilization of a joint sponsor, the I-130 petitioner (i.e., the US spouse) still has to submit form I-864 on their behalf, even if they do not have any (or insufficient) income. There may be multiple submitted forms, depending on the joint sponsorship situation.\nInfo: I believe it is possible to contribute the applicant\u0026rsquo;s assets to this calculation, too (Part 7, fields 6-8 on form I-864)! In cases where you have a significant portion of assets, but no current job, this may be a suitable alternative, and requires filing form I-864A (I believe). However, there are some restrictions on the assets to use (\u0026ldquo;the assets must be convertible to cash within 12 months\u0026rdquo;, and further requirements on the accessibility from the US). Since we didn\u0026rsquo;t use any particular assets, I cannot comment on the exact process here.\nInfo: One of the final caveats that I want to mention is the fact that income listed in I-864 has to be an estimate of the income in the current year, and not from the year of the provided tax return(s)!\nInfo: RE: the previous info point, you will have to submit IRS tax returns of any financial sponsor as \u0026ldquo;supporting evidence\u0026rdquo; of past income. At the very minimum, this has to be the most recent tax return, but additional returns of up to the past three years may be provided. From my research, the additional tax returns may be beneficial for cases where the income was lower in the more recent years. In case sponsors show a sufficient income on the most recent return, it is usuall advised against submitting more than one return.\nOther Important wording/things that took us some time to figure out:\nFor DCF processes, the NVC number IS your Consulate Case Number (starting with, e.g., FRN******* for the Frankfurt Consulate). This is relevant for \u0026ldquo;signing\u0026rdquo; petition DS-260, which can only be completed with the additional provision of the \u0026ldquo;NVC number\u0026rdquo;. It is expected that some fields in the CEAC platform are disabled when going through a DCF. Particularly, the \u0026ldquo;choice of agent\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;paying fees\u0026rdquo; section cannot be completed, as they are not applicable (see this discussion). Instead, you will be expected to pay the fees during your visa interview, which follows after filing form DS-260, and the \u0026ldquo;agent\u0026rdquo; is the consular officer. Part 3: The Visa Appointment \u0026amp; Medical Exam Medical Exam The medical checks are notoriously difficult to get, especially after delays due to Covid impaired the immigration processes for many people after 2020. In fact, the situation got so bad that the Consulate now specifically allows exemptions beyond the original visa appointment to obtain a medical exam. In our case, booking an appointment with the nearest certified doctor\u0026rsquo;s office (in Frankfurt) had appointments available roughly three months out! However, I can highly recommend the office in Frankfurt, if only for the reason that they allow you to sign up to a service that announces earlier appointments once they become available. While they were generally re-assigned within 15 minutes of the mail, it still allowed us to get a scheduled appointment a month prior to the original appointment.\nDepending on your panel physician, parts of the exam will have to be completed prior to the medical exam appointment, such as the chest x-rays (e.g., this is the case for an appointment in Munich), or required vaccinations. While some vaccines can be done same-day, others, such as the Covid-19 vaccine, will have to be administered in multiple doses and are thus required in advance (or at the very least, the medical exam can only be completed if everything is there). For me, one of the crucial questions was related to the immunity of varicella, which is a required vaccination. Since I was infected with Chickenpox as a kid, I should have the immunity, but I did not have any mention of it in my vaccination card. However, this is no problem, as the doctor\u0026rsquo;s office simply let me put down a confirmation that I am immune due to a previous infection. The statement is obviously made under legal oath, but it was at least not required to obtain any further tests (which I did, anyways, just to be sure).\nInfo: Another note is that the medical exam results are usually only valid for 6 months and require verification of an ongoing immigration process for the appointment (e.g., the DS-260 confirmation page or a Case Number) when entering the clinic.\nAppointment at the Consulate The eventual visa appointment at the Frankfurt consulate is quite stressful. I would encourage you to be there earlier rather than later, as the queue to get inside the consulate can easily exceed a ~20 minute waiting time. However, it seems the officers were prepared for delays, and you were ultimately called with a number given upon registration inside the consulate. So don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about it if you are late. FWIW, all waiting times are for a \u0026ldquo;random Tuesday\u0026rdquo; in July, although I think available appointments were only available on weekdays, anyways.\nAs for your US spouse (the petitioner), they can technically enter the consulate with you to partake in the visa appointment. However, the things that you are allowed to bring inside with you are very limited (no phone, no additional documents, no backpack or anything). As such, we decided that it would be best for my wife to wait outside with our phones/bags, and only enter if necessary for clarification. I am actually not sure if they have some lockers there, but you can definitely not bring anything else in there. Security is really tight.\nI also didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel the need of having her with me at the interview, as I was completely fine answering questions on my own, and handling the application documents, as I primarily prepared them myself, anyways.\nInside the consulate, it is all about figuring out which lines are the appropriate one, but consulate staff are extremely helpful (and surprisingly friendly, all things considered). Usually, \u0026ldquo;permanent residence\u0026rdquo; immigration cases are handled separately from \u0026ldquo;tourist visas\u0026rdquo;, so the waiting times were relatively speaking much shorter. I think I waited another 15 minutes to register my case with a first consulate officer, followed by a brief visit to the bursary to pay the necessary immigration fees (325$, which are usually paid through NVC when submitting US-based applications or direct USCIS filings). After that, I had to wait roughly another 20 minutes until my assigned waiting number got called and I talked to a final consulate staff member. During the first conversation, I had to submit all required documents, including my passport. After figuring out that I had indeed forgotten one thing (a confirmation slip for the home delivery option), I was handed another sheet that told me how to submit the \u0026ldquo;missing evidence\u0026rdquo; later on (simply by e-mail, with a particular code). Aside from this, I was fortunate that I had all required documents at hand, which also included supporting evidence for the I-864 affidavits (i.e., tax returns) and original documents. Paying the outstanding fee was much more convenient than the filing of form I-130, as I could bring a credit card to pay at a terminal, but cash would have been fine, too (AFAIK, foreign currencies would have also been accepted).\nWhen I got called to the counter for the eventual \u0026ldquo;interview\u0026rdquo;, our conversation consisted of relatively few questions about the relationship with my spouse, the financial situation of her and my father-in-law (the official joint sponsor). However, given the nature of our application, it seemed that this was already more than sufficient for the visa officer, and I was promptly told that (given the timely submission of missing documents and availability of all other documents) I could expect a positive outcome very soon.\nI understand that, once again, this is likely on the shorter side for a residence interview, and I am sure that depending on personal circumstances, this may be a lot more involved than it was for myself.\nPost Interview After the interview was over, I was told that I could leave the consulate again. Once back at home, we submitted the missing delivery notice through the web form, and were waiting for the eventual response. Again, I have to compliment the Frankfurt Consulate on their response times, as we got a \u0026ldquo;package delivery notification\u0026rdquo; about a successful pickup of documents not 3 days later. Based on the prepared passport, we were able to tell that the whole process seemed to have been a success (yay!), and it was now only up to the eventual border officers to admit me into the country once I enter for the first time. The delivered package also contained some further information on the immigration process, as well as the (in our case, big!) packet of documents that only the eventual immigration officer at the US border is supposed to open. From what we later heard, this seems to be particular to the Frankfurt Consulate, and may not be the case for other countries; there seems also the option to digitally transmit the majority of these documents, in which case the packet might be a lot smaller.\nOne remaining step was to pay an outstanding fee of another 220$, which is basically paying for the eventual print-out and delivery of the physical green gard (i.e., document I-551), which can only be received inside the US upon immigration. In the meantime, the passport visa page serves as a temporary I-551, and can be used as a means of identification etc. It also includes an assigned \u0026ldquo;Alien Registration Number\u0026rdquo;, which has frequently popped up in forms, and seems to be a helpful indicator for unique identification (in the absence of a Social Security Number).\nSpeaking of, the Social Security Number (SSN) will also only be assigned after your first successful entry, and (from what I understand) needs at least another 2-3 weeks for assignment. However, at least a further registration for the SSN is not necessary, as long as you indicated the respective boxes in form DS-260 about automatically forwarding information to the Social Security Administration, which is responsible for assigning the SSN. Other instructions included in the visa package were pretty self-explanatory, and mainly discussed the eventual duration of the temporary I-551, procedures during a first entry.\nInfo: During the visa interview, I was asked when my planned immigration was. I answered truthfully, and am not sure if the indicated date has something to do with the processing speed at the consulate. As our planned immigration date was roughly a month after the visa interview, I am extremely glad that the consulate was processing everything so quickly, irrespective of the reasons.\nInfo: The forms are pretty clear that the immigration (or at least processing) of your physical I-551 is not possible until the outstanding fee is paid to USCIS. While it is again possible to pay by credit card, we did that as soon as possible, to avoid any hassle during the immigration process itself.\nImmigrating Immigrating was probably the most anticlimactic part of the entire process. There are a few times when it should definitely be mentioned that you are immigrating, instead of visiting, especially during the airport check-in. There, desk agents will use the visa page in your passport instead of checking your ESTA (or tourist visa). Once arriving in the US, you can simply proceed to the regular customs operations for tourists (at least, this was the way at Newark International Airport, where we arrived). The immigrations officer will then take your provided documents (if any were sent to you beforehand), and take you to a separate area for immigrants. My wife was allowed to join me during this, by the way. There, the process was fairly quick: the agent took the document folder, briefly (like, literally less than a minute) looked at the provided paperwork, stamped my passport, and wished us all the best before sending us on our way. Unlike me, you should definitely immediately check for the stamp provided on or next to your immigrant visa page, because this effectively \u0026ldquo;validates\u0026rdquo; the temporary I-551. If you read closely on the page, it states that \u0026ldquo;upon endorsement, serves as a temporary I-551 evidencing permanent residence for 1 year\u0026rdquo;, which means that only with the stamp this document carries any weight within the US.\nAnd with that, it is done! The last step was to get all of our luggage, but the immigration was finally complete :) The eventual next steps still include the wait for the physical green card, which is supposed to take several weeks after arrival, as well as obtaining the SSN.\nTotal Cost The entire process for applying to the Green Card is quite costly. The summation of the associated costs for my specific case can be broken down roughly as follows\n535 $ - Filing fee form I-130 (to be paid as a cheque!) 40 $ - certified translation of documents (only 2 pages were actually translated) 325 $ - Filing fee form DS-260 (paid at the consulate during the visa interview) 430 $ - (390€) Medical Exam (costs may vary depending on the specific doctor\u0026rsquo;s office) 16 $ - (~16€) Additional lab tests for medical exam (cost may vary depending on required tests) 10 $ - Stamps for special delivery letters (cheque US to Germany \u0026amp; Sending the I-130 package) 28 $ - US passport-style pictures for both petitioner and beneficiary 120 $ - Travel costs to/from Frankfurt (medical exam + visa appointment) 30 $ - \u0026ldquo;Premium Delivery\u0026rdquo; of visa package (the alternative is pick-up in Frankfurt) 220 $ - USCIS processing fee (to be paid before first arrival)\n= 1754 $ Total\nInfo: The \u0026ldquo;financial support form processing fee\u0026rdquo; (120$), which is required for US-based processing, is not applicable for the consular filing process.\nInfo: The lab tests for myself were quite cheap, presumably because of a short medical history. The Frankfurt doctor\u0026rsquo;s office estimated an upper limit of closer to 150$ on top of the regular fee, so be prepared to pay a bit more if you have a more complicated history.\nInfo: On top, for the CR-1 visa, we will be required to further file for the removal of conditions on residence (I-751), which costs another 595$. This is due after the initial duration of two years, and comes with its separate application process. This process is (AFAIK) only required for recently married couples, and you would be directly granted an IR-1 10-year Green Card otherwise.\nConclusion Relatively, our own process can be summed up as a \u0026ldquo;speedrun\u0026rdquo; of the US immigration system, relative to stories that you read on the web. From our initial filing until the eventual issuance of the temporary immigration visa, it took just under 3.5 months, with a (somewhat voluntary) wait for the visa interview due to international travel. If we had pushed it, we could have likely gotten this visa in less than three months. However, we already gave the issue a ton of previous thoughts, had amazing support throughout the process, access to past and present documents with relative ease, and still dealt with additional problems not covered in this post: among others, these \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; include finding temporary immigrant insurance, dealing with finding a future residence, interviewing for jobs (for myself as the immigrant), conditional on a successful immigration, etc. For these reasons, I only really encourage a faster processing if you have enough time to spend on the immigration process itself.\nI really hope that the details in this post may help one or the other person, even though several conditions have to be met in the first place. As stated in the beginning, I am looking forward to hear about your feedback, immigration stories (US or elsewhere), and whether you would like to read more about this topic!\nComplete Timeline April 14, 2023: Submission of I66: Request for Expedited Visa Processing to Frankfurt Consulate General.

May 19, 2023: Submission of form DS-260, notifying Consulate of the submission. May 23, 2023: Acceptance notification by the Consulate, instructed to schedule appointment. May 23, 2023: Scheduling visa appointment. The soonest dates for the appointment are within a week. We chose a later date, because I still had to travel abroad in the meantime and the medical exams were available much later anyways. May/June 2023: Collection of supporting documents for visa appointment June 2023: Collection of medical history from previous GP/specialists. None of the obtained documents were particularly helpful in the end. The primary reference for filling out the requested document by the medical exam office were my parents (and their knowledge of previous infections/conditions). June 22, 2023: Medical exam in Frankfurt, moved to an earlier appointment after alternatives became available (originally had it scheduled one week after the visa appointment in July). July 18, 2023: Visa appointment at the Frankfurt Consulate including (a very short) interview. July 18, 2023: Submission of missing document (page of delivery confirmation notice). July 20, 2023: Notification by GTS that documents are ready and will be delivered. July 22, 2023: Received the visa package, including a prepared page in the passport. August 21, 2023: Flight to the US and stamp on the immigrant page. I will update the timeline with the eventual arrival dates of my separate I-551 green card, as well as the processing time of the Social Security Number being assigned.\nThe Most Helpful Sources Frankfurt Consulate\u0026rsquo;s Visa Navigator: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEvNF5RK-2bvqW7SicenUtdxrPxl-4XfdyfR6FWoC3uNRk4g/viewform A great thread on Reddit with timeline for a spousal DCF process: https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/ra9ctf/direct_consular_filing_frankfurt_timeline/ Forum board clarifying the \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; of providing documents through CEAC for DCF: https://www.visajourney.com/forums/topic/774723-no-option-to-upload-documents-after-completing-ds-260/ ","date":"August 24, 2023","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://dennis-aumiller.de/posts/green-card/","summary":"Filing for a Spousal Green Card from Abroad, an Attempted Guide with Timeline TL;DR: Immigrating into the US is a long and arduous process, even on \u0026ldquo;easy mode\u0026rdquo; when obtaining a permanent residence through a spouse.

For someone currently doing their PhD on text summarization, this is both worrying, but obviously also a rather intriguing development: while recent advancements have been focusing on rather broadly applicable models (think, chatGPT), providing more task-specific alternatives seems to be the niche that Cohere is carving out for themselves.\nAdding to the surprise of seeing a dedicated summarization endpoint is the fact that text summarization is really hard; in the last 50 years, a lot of progress has been made, but our current state-of-the-art models still suffer from annoying problems such as correctly retaining factuality of the input text. Another problem is the actual definition of \u0026ldquo;summaries\u0026rdquo; in different domains. Methods for generating a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; summary of a news article are generally useless when it comes to generating the summary of a court ruling, or generating radiology reports from doctor notes. Due to the combination of these (and other) factors, there are comparatively few productive settings in which summarization is actively used. To my knowledge, the two main applications using some form of summarization right now are some news aggregators, summarizing information from multiple news articles (which primarily uses extractive methods, meaning directly copying existing sentences from the input documents), as well as the recently introduced \u0026ldquo;Document TL;DR\u0026rdquo; generator in Google Docs (the latter using a variant of their own PEGASUS neural model).\nThis lack of tooling and remaining issues also means that companies (read: \u0026ldquo;paying customers\u0026rdquo;) are relatively unlikely to employ summarization systems or plan task settings where they would be directly used. While the imagined benefits of summarization systems are high, the current risks associated with their usage and the practical issues arising from their usage still outweigh these benefits. However, the fact that Cohere has a free tier available, as well as their claim of having a broadly applicable endpoint, makes it drastically more available to not only customers, but also the associated research community (and other folks keen on exploring AI-based tooling). To get a first feel of the new offering, I took the API for a spin, and want to put this new endpoint into the context of currently ongoing research.\nWhat we know about their model The blog post announcing the feature gives about as much detail as one can hope from a company: Opening with an accurate and concise system-generated TL;DR, the article then goes on to talk about some of the basic properties available. To me, the most interesting fact is the unusually long context available for this model (50,000 characters max). To put this length into context, we can compare it to the usually employed unit of \u0026ldquo;subword tokens\u0026rdquo;. These are vaguely similar to syllables, meaning a word can be broken down into individual sub-parts, to cut down on the required vocabulary for any collection of texts (note that this is a very generic simplification of the topic and should not be taken at face value; in fact, most subwords specifically do not correspond to actual syllables). Assuming a mean subword token length of about 6 characters (based on some basic back-of-the-envelope math on top of bert-base-uncased model\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary file), the popular 512 subword limit of most transformer models comes to about ~3,100 characters in length for comparison. Extrapolating to around 50,000 characters puts this in the ballpark range of 8,192 subword units of context length, which is on the extremely high end of contexts considered in recent research.\nHowever, a key detail about the model is hidden further down in the article:\n\u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;]We extract key sentences from the document up to the context length, and then generate a synthetic document composed of the combination of those key sentences.\u0026rdquo;\nHybrid Summarization to the rescue! This is a strong indicator that Cohere makes use of a joint architecture which is known as a hybrid summarization system, and is a popular trick to circumvent the general length limitations of transformer models. As described in the quote, the first part of a hybrid summarization pipeline consists of a \u0026ldquo;selector\u0026rdquo; method, which will highlight and extract a number of segments (usually sentences) in the original document. In research, this is also called an \u0026ldquo;extractive\u0026rdquo; summarization system, and will ensure that any text part is guaranteed to appear in the input document, which makes generation both cheaper and faster. Ultimately, this first stage is therefore used to drastically cut down the context length, without sacrificing too much loss in relevant content for the final summary at this stage.\nOnly during the subsequent stage, a larger (and more expensive) language model is then run to actually generate what we call an \u0026ldquo;abstractive\u0026rdquo; system, i.e., generated text does not necessarily appear in the original input, and can constitute a re-write of segments (or, more worryingly, can be made up completely). Importantly, this use of preliminary selectors, which are often comparatively cheap approaches, drastically improve the computational efficiency of the entire pipeline compared to a \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo; approach, such as feeding an input text directly into a GPT-like model.\nA likely extractor There are of course different ways in which the pre-selection can be done, and nothing more is said in the article itself. Without further information, we can speculate on the specific details based on popular extractive models (which constitute the first part of the pipeline).\nGiven the input length limitations, it is unlikely that Cohere is employing an extractive model which is performing extractive summarization with Transformers, e.g., PreSumm or similar libraries. This is based primarily on the fact that the length limitations are also applicable in extractive settings. Furthermore, utilizing a supervised extractive model requires additional training data on \u0026ldquo;segment relevance\u0026rdquo; (i.e., judging which sentences are to be extracted); this again is highly dependent on the text\u0026rsquo;s domain and potentially limiting the generalizing qualities of such a system.\nIn my opinion more likely is a pipeline employing an unsupervised approach. Here, no specific training data is required, and oftentimes these methods have a decent performance across different domains. One very likely approach is the combination of LexRank, a tried-and-tested method from 2004, augmented with modern sentence embeddings. This use case is even suggested by Nils Reimers, himself Director of Machine Learning at Cohere. Especially with Cohere providing dedicated (multilingual) embedding endpoints, this is also a neat way to integrate several of their endpoints in one go.\nFinally, it can be argued that unsupervised approaches also provide a more reasonable cost for inference, depending on their use of neural architectures internally. However, using embeddings generated with neural models kind of defeats any argument on performance, so this is no certainty.\nDetails on the abstractive part Based on further parameters available, there seems to be good reason to assume that the abstractive model is largely based on Cohere\u0026rsquo;s existing .generate() architecture, with some additional fine-tuning towards specific summarization tasks. We can assume that some labeled training data was obtained to learn the distinction of different output styles (paragraph vs bullets) and extractiveness (note that this parameter is not available in the Beta playground endpoint, but rather only mentioned in the docs). I have tried to extract portions of the used prompt, however, it seems that Cohere has sufficient query blockers in place to prevent a \u0026ldquo;quick investigation\u0026rdquo; from my side, at least. Based on the \u0026ldquo;additional command\u0026rdquo; parameter, it seems that a model following the instruction-fine-tuning paradigm was already used for this purpose, which would make this more similar to Cohere\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;command-xlarge-nightly\u0026rdquo; model than the older (more generic) \u0026ldquo;xlarge\u0026rdquo; variant.\nTesting the waters With the speculations about implementation details out of the way, we can now actually take a look at the systems and some preliminary outputs tested by yours truly. Note that this is still a rather anecdotal evaluation on a fairly small (but diverse) document set and a more thorough investigation is planned for the future.\nIn particular, I have a few general points that I look out for when interacting with summarization systems and that I will also focus on in this preliminary investigation:\nAre they capable of retaining factuality between the input and the summary? What part of the text is relevant information extracted from? Are relevant sentences clustered around the beginning, or actually appearing later in the text? How does the model perform for texts from different domains (legal, financial texts)? How well does the system perform for texts that are not in English? Are there any other non-grammatical outputs, such as repetitions or otherwise incoherent segments? As a secondary focus, what is the inference time of the model? The \u0026ldquo;dataset\u0026rdquo; I wanted to cover some fairly diverse settings, which at the same time have some relation to my own research (primarily non-English summarization and long-form summarization). These were the documents I have experimented with:\nOne of my own papers, since I can fairly accurately judge the accuracy of the resulting summary without having to read the entire document. For conversion, I rendered it with arxiv-vanity and manually removed the abstract from the document to encourage sentence selection from portions not at the beginning. A mail conversation I had with a colleague about a technical topic. This rather long thread is in German, which further makes this an interesting sample document of cross-lingual summarization, in addition to also being fairly difficult as a \u0026ldquo;turn-based\u0026rdquo; conversation. A news article from today\u0026rsquo;s list of articles on cnn.com, to avoid news articles already present in the training corpus. I particularly picked one where the information is rather well-distributed across the article, and not just present in the first few sentences again. A (fairly short) German law book. I used the \u0026ldquo;Verordnung über das Meisterprüfungsberufsbild und über die Prüfungsanforderungen in den Teilen I und II der Meisterprüfung im Dachdecker-Handwerk (Dachdeckermeisterverordnung - DachdMstrV)\u0026rdquo; (a law about obtaining an advanced associate\u0026rsquo;s degree for the roofer trade) don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why this one, it was the first one I clicked. A quick note on the reproducibility: The temperature setting for all my experiments was between 0.0 and 0.8, which is fairly low. Even so, with non-zero temperature, the reproducibility of results is not guaranteed. This means that my insights (despite attempts with repeated \u0026ldquo;sampling\u0026rdquo;) may not be always the same. Please bear this in mind!\nResult Summary \u0026ldquo;Recursive Summarization\u0026rdquo;: Summarizing my own work on summarization with the Cohere endpoint.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with some interesting observations about the factuality of responses (1). Without generalizing from these results, I personally had much more success in obtaining consistent answers when going for generation in the \u0026ldquo;bullets\u0026rdquo; format over coherently written \u0026ldquo;paragraphs\u0026rdquo;. Especially the paragraphs format was extremely sensitive to the generation temperature, and even with fairly low values (0.3) I sometimes got completely unfounded facts (e.g., that my dataset was created by researchers at the \u0026ldquo;Max Planck Institute for Psycholingustics\u0026rdquo;, despite me being at Heidelberg University\u0026quot;).\nOtherwise, especially for news-like articles, the consistency was surprisingly good, even if some references where incorrectly attributed in the German-to-English setting.\nInstance of a factually incorrect statement. The law goes into effect on the 1st October, 2006 (last sentence in the German text); the stated date (23rd May 2006) is mentioned as the document creation date at the very beginning of the article.\nRegarding the multilinguality (4), I can happily report that it works to some extent; the endpoint is capable of \u0026ldquo;processing\u0026rdquo; German articles, but even with explicit prompts being added, will only respond in English. This is still a significant step-up, but probably not entirely useful for customers looking into summarizing documents in other languages. Translations were in my understanding pretty much always accurate; some fluency issues could be observed in the translation of the German law text, but I would argue that I myself could not have done a better job, either.\nSimilarly, fluency or repetitions have not been an issue at all (5). In none of the tested scenarios did I encounter output text that was plain \u0026ldquo;ungrammatical\u0026rdquo;. I am not sure if Cohere employs output post-processing steps, such as n-gram blocking or similar, but it seems that the RLHF-trained models (i.e., most instruction fine-tuned models right now) have less problems with that anyways.\nFor longer input texts, I noticed that the system was focusing a lot on what appears to be (sub-)headings of the texts, or otherwise shorter segments; this has happened to me when utilizing embedding-based extractive methods (such as the modified LexRank approach mentioned before), which are generally suited better for shorter segments. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but requires careful pre-processing by users for instances where the actual document body is more relevant than heading text.\nThe only problem regarding the sentence selection (2) was for the mail thread. While the output text accurately summarized the individual turns (e.g., individual responses without focusing on previous parts overly much), it failed to account for the \u0026ldquo;reading direction\u0026rdquo; of pasted mail inputs. Instead of reading \u0026ldquo;bottom-to-top\u0026rdquo;, as with most mail interactions, the system interpreted the reading direction as \u0026ldquo;top-to-bottom\u0026rdquo;, which inherently caused the summary to be inverted. The mail setting was also the example where it was the easiest to identify that sentences were not just chosen from the beginning, precisely because it did indeed focus on multiple different responses within the mail thread. The one negative thing about the mail summaries where the almost overly short summaries, even when setting to the longest output format. A particular variation in sentence length could be observed as well.\nFor other articles, it was a bit harder to tell where content was chosen from, especially for news-related documents (where important mentions are expected in the beginning, anyways). However, even in my own paper, it would refer to mentions that appeared well within the document body. This is a pretty decent indicator that it also works well in domains (3) where the input is less uniform than a news article. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to test it with medical documents (partially because I also lack domain knowledge), but for the legal use case it performed somewhat okay.\nA final word in the inference times (6): I would say that currently the model is prohibitively slow for any text \u0026gt;10,000 characters, unless latency is not an issue (e.g., for pre-computed summaries). For the paper, processing time went on for around 4-6 seconds (estimated), but shorter texts were obviously much faster. I\u0026rsquo;m also not sure if there are added benefits of using the non-free tier for inference latencies, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? This poses a question to which we certainly have a less clear picture right now.\nIn my opinion, there are several ways which are logical and immediate follow-ups on the existing model endpoint. I expect that they will expand the examples and documentation website. Currently, linked pages in their docs about summarization still refer to the general-purpose generation endpoint (see, \u0026ldquo;Build a summarizaiton app\u0026rdquo; in the bottom left), which is precisely not the one to use for this task.\nSecondly, explicit training for multilingual summary experiences could be a possible extension. The model already exhibits a (albeit weak) multilingual tendency, which allows users to explore foreign-to-English summarization settings. If Cohere manages to extend their functionality to some of the other languages with a potential customer base, this could be a realistic extension.\nSomething that will also likely be expanded is the degree of customization possible. While the (beta) endpoint already includes generic parameters such as \u0026ldquo;length\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;extractiveness\u0026rdquo; and a mild form of styling (\u0026ldquo;bullets\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;paragraphs\u0026rdquo; being the available choices), recent trends in summarization research have shifted to a much broader degree of \u0026ldquo;controllable generation\u0026rdquo;. Similar directions can be observed in the \u0026ldquo;more general LLM research\u0026rdquo;, where instruction-tuned tooling is strongly preferred by users over more generic LLMs.\nWhile there is also an option to give user-specified free-form instructions is already in place, it currently does not seem to affect the produced output too much. If Cohere manages to expand on the customization options available this way, a much more generic set of \u0026ldquo;summarization-like\u0026rdquo; tasks could be approached. This includes, for example, writing entity-centric summaries, where the summary provides a much more targeted text compared to a (broader) input document, or data-to-text settings, which is highly relevant in financial/business settings.\nHowever, more important will be the degree of adoption by clients; I suspect that we will see the emergence of more tailored endpoints in the near future, which specifically cater to the needs of different specialized domains, again, possibly for specific legal/financial/medical documents. Here, a much stricter focus on factuality is generally required, and if useful application scenarios can be identified, it requires the adoption of slightly more consistent summary generation than currently possible. I am not fully convinced at this point that the \u0026ldquo;extractiveness\u0026rdquo; parameter delivers the required level of factual accuracy, yet. I also have a particular pet-peeve with the \u0026ldquo;randomness\u0026rdquo; introduced by the temperature parameter in general, as it prevents reproducible outputs at all, it seems. If users are interested in consistent answers, then the bullets-style format seems to be the more reliable choice.\nIn summary (no pun intended), it seems that Cohere has not released a major groundbreaking leap forward at the scale of chatGPT \u0026ndash; but they might not have to. Providing a highly usable experience to a smaller set of dedicated users can pay off for them in the long run; a concise feature set with real application value to users will ultimately beat the comparatively flashy but less straightforward chatGPT. As for myself, I am currently evaluating the model on a broader dataset for performance on academically used evaluation metrics; so stay tuned for a part two!\nPS: This post\u0026rsquo;s title image was taken in UBC\u0026rsquo;s beautiful Botanical Garden, which I visited just before starting my exchange year in Toronto in August 2017.\n","date":"March 5, 2023","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://dennis-aumiller.de/posts/cohere-summarization/","summary":"Two weeks ago, Cohere.ai announced their new dedicated summarization endpoint! For someone currently doing their PhD on text summarization, this is both worrying, but obviously also a rather intriguing development: while recent advancements have been focusing on rather broadly applicable models (think, chatGPT), providing more task-specific alternatives seems to be the niche that Cohere is carving out for themselves.\nAdding to the surprise of seeing a dedicated summarization endpoint is the fact that text summarization is really hard; in the last 50 years, a lot of progress has been made, but our current state-of-the-art models still suffer from annoying problems such as correctly retaining factuality of the input text.","tags":["Summarization"],"title":"Discovery of the New Cohere Summarization Endpoint"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I recently started clearing out some of my old browser bookmarks, something I highly encourage you to do, too! Given that I have been in the academic world for close to ten years now, I still mix a lot of my personal browsing with the professionally required one, which created more and more bloat over time in my browser.\nAside from the Mari Kondo-esque liberation it gives, I initially went through my bookmarks to finally start separating them into various categories, putting a more distinct divide between my \u0026ldquo;personal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; online footprint. In some sense, it also felt like clearing out a childhood bedroom, given that I have consistently used the same browser (Firefox) for close to fifteen years now, and certainly not all bookmarks hold the same relevance today as back then.\nGrowing up with the Internet, the title phrase \u0026ldquo;the Internet never forgets\u0026rdquo; has been deeply ingrained into my memory, and I always more or less believed this to be true. But actually going through some of my \u0026ldquo;web memories\u0026rdquo; from longer ago meant re-visiting sites that I initially assumed to give me a glimpse into the past and, to my surprise, many of them were no longer accessible.\nI know that the original meaning of the phrase is generally supposed to indicate the free spreading of information, and unwanted sharing of sensitive information; however, while I could certainly track some of the saved pages via various web archives or even Googling them, it seems that the Internet is in fact more forgetful about things than we might have originally anticipated.\nThis is especially exacerbated by the rise of more dynamic web content, culminating in the recent trend of SPA sites. Not only do they make it more difficult to perform effective web search over them, but they also diminish the chances of page content being included in web archives.\nTo broadly categorize the types of \u0026ldquo;dead links\u0026rdquo; I found, these are the most prominent instances in my personal experience:\nMemes and other static content from \u0026ldquo;managed sites\u0026rdquo;, e.g., Reddit, news sites, etc., was among the most prominent dead links. I can attribute this to two major reasons: Either users deleting their accounts (and with them some of the posts) or simply cleansing of old content after a certain time period. These are also by far the most likely to still appear in archives, as they come with their individual URL and have a high likelihood of being crawled due to popularity of the domain. Websites where the entire domain was taken down. These include primarily personal websites or smaller sites, which are nowadays frequently replaced with managed/hosted sites or sub-communities on other platforms (again, e.g., Reddit). This mainly removes the burden of protecting one\u0026rsquo;s own servers against attackers, which is incredibly tedious (I vaguely remember a paper talking about how the first attacks on a new server nowadays start within an hour of it first going online. If you know of the title of this work, please reach out, I could not find it!). Also, hosting costs have decreased significantly over the past ten years, but due to different platforms, older content was not moved to newer pages. Funnily enough, a lot of academic pages also went \u0026ldquo;MIA\u0026rdquo;. I had a particular number of math scripts that were no longer accessible, as the respective authors seem to have moved academic institutions. Based on personal experience, I can also say that this is (in part) to blame on the institutions\u0026rsquo; weak admin support. Case in point, my academic mail would be deleted soon after I finish graduation, and I have to petition to extend the accessibility beyond my student days. What makes all of this particularly challenging is that bookmarks in themselves do not hold a lot of information on the actual content (\u0026ldquo;why did I even bookmark this in the first place?\u0026rdquo;). This makes the already tedious follow-up of searching for this particular content unnecessarily hard and something I will likely not do for many of the out-of-date bookmarks.\nIn a neat tie to my current research in text processing, this also has interesting effects on reproducibility of large-scale web-based datasets. Given that we often only provide the links to websites instead of the static content (partially for storage space reasons, partially because of legal rights), we cannot ascertain a fully reproducible result, and should never naively assume that content is available in the same state in the future (even on pages like Wikipedia, content will evidently change over time). And simultaneously, having a single point of failure for centralized access of data is similarly worrying, if just for the unlikely case of that particular hoster going belly-up.\nWith that said, I did have a great time reveling in the memories of pages that I had not accessed in a decade (and which were still working); and I again encourage you to do the same! If you do find any similar types of \u0026ldquo;missing content\u0026rdquo;, feel free to let me know!\nPS: I have just enabled custom \u0026ldquo;hero images\u0026rdquo; (as they are called in Hugo), which you can see at the top.

Especially since I am not a trained web developer, I quickly realized that there are quite a few significant hurdles to overcome before I could have a somewhat decent system that relies on minimal outside dependencies, and even then, I already had acquired quite a bit of external \u0026ldquo;npm bloat\u0026rdquo;. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t even include the time I had to spend figuring out how to efficiently update my website in case of changes without requiring logins to my server every couple of days\u0026hellip;\nDeciding to finally move on, I was looking around for a bit to see which pages (and template styles) where particularly attractive for a \u0026ldquo;dual use site\u0026rdquo;. I wanted to be represented both in my current academic role, but also in a future career in industry. The focus on each of these is slightly different, which makes an integration suitable for both aspects challenging.\nUltimately, the new website is based on the wonderful Hugo template toha, which I have modified in some key aspects to suit my own style slightly better.\nFunnily enough, one of the tasks that cost me by far the most time was me trying to stubbornly shuffle around the socials buttons right to the top. Even now, I still do not have it properly centered for all devices (especially apparent on mobile), but there is still time to fix this in the future.\nDespite this effort, the site does a much better job at allowing me to post regular content, as it offers a dedicated blog page, which you are currently reading! In particular, the close ties to markdown in Hugo makes it trivially easy for me to write content, without having to edit later styling elements by hand, which was a huge plus in the decision to move forward.\nSome of the more general points that I want to highlight in my experience with Hugo (and this particular template) so far, including some of the encountered downsides:\nHugo does offer a variety of templates that all do look nice in their respective demo pages (see many of the examples directly linked in the Hugo template gallery). However, choosing one that actually satisfies all the criteria for my own needs is quite tricky. I wanted a reactive view, incorporation of publications, a dedicated blog page, as well as a template that could in the future be easily changed towards a more \u0026ldquo;industry-focused\u0026rdquo; website, assuming that I move out of academia. Even when there are sites that (on paper) match all these points, it is not immediately clear how high the effort additional required effort is to customize these pages, which was a bit annoying. At least the template I went with, toha, does offer an exceptionally well-written document that explains how to set up different page elements, but does not give too much details on how to adjust these beyond the \u0026ndash; sometimes rather basic \u0026ndash; additional properties. Developing the page itself was comparatively a very pleasant experience. hugo [-D] server is an exceptional feature, automatically reloading pages. When something went terribly wrong and the page wouldn\u0026rsquo;t load at all, the error logs were usually concise enough to figure out the cause rather quickly. This is also especially nice, since it does not require me to maintain a list of dependencies like with npm. The templating itself is fairly intuitive, and for users having some basic experience with \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; HTML/CSS/JS stacks, the page elements will feel very familiar. Despite having never worked with Hugo before, I was able to easily make modifications to otherwise more complex elements like dynamically built lists. To be fair, a large portion probably also depends on the cleanliness and maintenance of the used template, so I highly recommend looking for an actively maintained project with a minimum popularity, to save yourself some headache. I personally run the Hugo server through a nginx reverse proxy, which caused me some headache during the first deployment. I would say this can be largely attributed to my prior experience with nginx, which is not much\u0026hellip; Still, I believe that with regards to deployments (or other configuration options beyond what is Hugo), there are still not too many resources out there. It could have also been that I was simply not looking in the right place, or for the right terms.This is less of an issue if one were to deploy through Github pages, where a ton of tutorials exist, which brings me to my next point. For inexperienced users, or people that really want to have a minimal amount of interaction with the site setup, the end-to-end tutorials for Github pages are fantastic. A large portion of the issues I encountered stemmed from me wanting to change things beyond the basics that were provided. This included both the internal Hugo features (e.g., styling or page elements), as well as the deployment (hosted on my own infrastructure instead of Github pages). Finally, I am still missing some of the key features that a modern website should now offer out of the box: I had to create a manual \u0026ldquo;blog-like\u0026rdquo; entry, which currently serves as my imprint and data privacy note. With a general focus on privacy aspects in the recent years, I was surprised that even now, Hugo (or rather, the current template) does not natively ship with a cookie banner extension. Ultimately, I will likely stick with this page for a while; especially since I still do have some issues to deal with. Also, optimization is an aspect that I really like to take seriously. Unfortunately, from an SEO perspective, the current state of the site is also far from being optimal. But at least it is a start. I am still not sure how frequently (or lengthy) I will post on this website, but at least the basis of the blog is finally done!\n","date":"August 9, 2022","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://dennis-aumiller.de/posts/new-website/","summary":"I have recently migrated my personal website, which turned out to be hugely outdated, since I originally planned to write a platform entirely from scratch (spoiler: not a great idea with time constraints).
