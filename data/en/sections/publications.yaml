- title: "Evaluating Factual Consistency of Texts with Semantic Role Labeling"
  publishedIn:
    name: "*SEM @ ACL 2023"
    date: July 2023
    url: https://sites.google.com/view/starsem2023

  - name: Michael Gertz
  paper:
    summary: Automatically checking whether generated text is factually consistent with an input segment is still challenging. We present a method that goes against the recent trend of directly utilizing large language models to evaluate factuality, and instead propose a more linguistically grounded approach, based on Semantic Role Labels.

- title: "Time for some German? Pre-Training a Transformer-based Temporal Tagger for German"
  publishedIn:
    name: Text2Story @ ECIR 2022

  authors:

  paper:
    summary: "Following a series of prior experiments in English, we outline a generalized training procedure for training a non-English temporal tagger with weakly supervised data. For this purpose, we utilize existing rule-based taggers as a way to scale up existing training resources in low-resource settings by several orders of magnitude."

  paper:
    summary: In this (German) article, we outline the challenges that are currently preventing mainstream adoption of recent NLP advancements in the legal industry. Primarily, this can be attributed to a lack of proper domain generalization, as well as limited interpretability and scalability of such models.

- title: "BERT got a Date: Introducing Transformers to Temporal Tagging"
  publishedIn:
    name: arXiv
    date: Sept 2021
    url: https://arxiv.org
  authors:
  - name: Satya Almasian*
  - name: Dennis Aumiller*
  - name: Michael Gertz
  paper:
    summary: "We experimented with various transformer-based architectures to see which ones would work best for extracting temporal annotations, such as 'yesterday' or 'every week'. However, we have since found a significant flaw in our evaluation setup for seq2seq-based models, so we decided to retract this article. Resulting tagging-based models are still valid, though, and are [available online](https://huggingface.co/satyaalmasian/temporal_tagger_BERT_tokenclassifier)."

- title: "Structural Text Segmentation of Legal Documents"
  publishedIn:

  authors:

  - name: Michael Gertz
  paper:
    summary: "Utilizing existing segmentation tools, which primarily operate on sentence-level granularity, yields poor performance when segmenting long documents, which are prevalent in a legal context. In this work, we address the issue by proposing a weakly-supervised paragraph-based segmenter, which we empirically show on a novel dataset consisting of web Terms of Service documents."

  paper:
    summary: "We participated in the workshop's shared task on extracting relevant paper sections in cited works. Interestingly, we show that our setup based on traditional search heuristics, coupled with improved pre-processing steps, outperforms our BERT-based retrieval setup. Overall, we placed third on the blind shared task test set."

  paper:
    summary: "Results from my Master's thesis contributed the experimental section of this work. Primarly, we present a theoretical retrieval model based on hypergraphs, and demonstrate that these operations can be utilized to perform common Information Retrieval operations more efficiently on co-occurrence based word networks than traditional dyadic graphs."

  authors:

  paper:
    summary: "Ordering events in a chronological fashion requires a accurate modeling of the temporal hierarchy, which previously was not well-defined for long-term event horizons spanning several decades. Here, we present a temporal model that is shown to work well, even without explicit temporal ordering in underlying document collections."
