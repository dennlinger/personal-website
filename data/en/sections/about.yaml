# a summary about you
summary: 'I am currently a Member of Technical Staff at Cohere, where I focus on improving human evaluation for Large Language Models. Before that, I obtained my PhD from the [Data Science Group at Heidelberg University](https://ds.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aumiller). My academic work primarily focused on automatic text summarization, with a special interest in generating aspect-focused summaries. Beyond that, I do have a broader appreciation for research in applied Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I previously interned with [Amazon Research](https://amazon.science) and [SAP](https://sap.com), and helped build a search engine for lawyers at [Codefy](https://codefy.de/).
During my PhD studies, I committed to releasing most of my research artifacts [on Github](https://github.com/dennlinger). However, my biggest contributions to open source are my [questions and answers on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3607203/dennlinger), which have by now reached more than one million people worldwide.'
