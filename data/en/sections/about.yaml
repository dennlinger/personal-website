# a summary about you
summary: 'I am currently a fourth-year PhD Student at Heidelberg University, focusing primarily on Text Summarization, with a special interest in generating aspect-focused narratives. I do have a general interest in Natural Language Processing, particularly involving Machine Learning for NLP.
I previously interned with [Amazon Research](https://amazon.science) and [SAP](https://sap.com), and helped build a search backend for legal documents at [Codefy](https://codefy.de/).
As a commitment to open & reproducible research, I publish code repositories for my associated publications [on Github](https://github.com/dennlinger). As a further contribution to open source, my [questions and answers on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3607203/dennlinger) have to date reached more than half a million people worldwide.'
