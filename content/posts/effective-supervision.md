Talk about processes that I have ensured for effective supervision.

What are the main goals that students should learn about (IMO)?
What are the expectations we have?

How can students collaborate efficiently with teachers?

Mention "Making of a Manager" by Julie Zhou as inspiration

How do "academic supervision meetings" differ from industry leadership?
    - Freedom (of choice/for students) has to be reflected. Instead of making top-down decisions, asking "how do YOU think we should proceed?" is a much more valuable insight.
    - Having fixed deadlines and "small chunks" tasks is much harder; tasks are often undefined and time estimates are even harder than in regular SDE cycles.
    - Very little background on which students you should take on. We use practicals as a pipeline for theses, but then again, we don't have much choice at our institution. Even so, a structured application process and (individual) contribution lists are essential.
