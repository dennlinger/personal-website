I have recently migrated my personal website from my old codebase, which was entirely written from scratch, to a more flexible (and less time-consuming) Hugo-based website.

TODO:
  - Write about the advantages/disadvantages over the previous theme. This includes full ownership and understanding, as well as security issues. Primarily though time constraint, fluent transitions, etc. stuff in JS.
  - Also write about the new blog, which finally should host some articles.
